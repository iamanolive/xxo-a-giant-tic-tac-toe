# X-X-O: A Giant Tic Tac Toe

* Creating a variation of the Tic Tac Toe game using python and pygame

## Version 1.1.1

* Created on the 23rd of December, 2023.
* Has the ability to detect keyboard button presses, and inserts X or O (depending on the current turn) into the box whose index has been clicked.
* Exits game (game screen closes) whenever a player wins.
* Current code size is at a staggering 270 lines (this has to be the largest piece of code I've ever written for a single project to date)

### Goals for Version 1.1.2

* Add in the ability to display start and winner screens when the game first begins and whenever someone wins, instead of closing the game window directly (the code for this was technically written into Version 1.1.1, but it's buggy and doesn't work)
* Option of playing using a mouse, and detecting boxes using clicks.
